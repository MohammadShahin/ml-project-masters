topic :should good people are rewarded and bad people are punished in movies or dramas?SENT : when we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished.--------------------SENT : while there are also some people who do not like this.--------------------SENT : personally, i prefer to see good people get rewarded.--------------------SENT : however, if the good people always get an happy ending, i don’t think it’s proper.--------------------SENT : first, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring.--------------------SENT : if good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas.--------------------SENT : then we will feel less interested in them.--------------------SENT : but if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story.--------------------SENT : for example, hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl.--------------------SENT : but now many people, including me, have been tired with it.--------------------SENT : i don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again.--------------------SENT : so we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or tv programs.--------------------SENT : even in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes.--------------------SENT : and i think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies.--------------------SENT : so if children always watch the tv programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world.--------------------SENT : they will be misleading by those movies.--------------------SENT : and they may act like good people in order to get reward.--------------------SENT : once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person.--------------------SENT : but in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not.--------------------SENT : so we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.--------------------SENT : in fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful.--------------------SENT : some people may be encouraged to do good things.--------------------SENT : but like i said, this kind of behavior won’t last long, because someday they will realize the truth.--------------------SENT : so i suggest we should show people the truth in the stories.--------------------SENT : and if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends.--------------------SENT : based on my arguments above, i think movies and tv programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing.--------------------getting the predictions ...
